Latest version:  1.0.12
----------------------

binary:  https://github.com/af-newbie/akbash/build
source code: https://github.com/af-newbie/akbash

New in version 1.0.12
---------------------

    - reformatted the status page:
	    - added current pool info: difficulty, last share
	- added "wd_cmd=jsonp_summary;" command, can be used with akbash.html to view
	  status from multiple locations.
    - added akbash.htnml page to view status of remote akbash instances
	  Any number of XXXminer/akbash pairs can be added to view the consolidated
	  statistics of the whole farm.  This page makes AJAX calls to "wd_cmd=jsonp_summary;"
	  for each url defined atthe top ofthe page.  See the head section.
	  If you use more than 20 urls, you might want to space them out as most browsers AJAX
	  handling will choke on it. 
	- fixed bugs in parsing of ASIC device status coming from cgminer
	- fixed misc bugs in processing/allocation of device arrays

To install:
-----------

copy akbash.exe and akbash-btc.conf (akbash-ltc.conf) to any directory (eg. c:\akbash).  
Update akbash.conf with miner process lnk shortcut, location of log file, email address etc. 

If you compile from sources, akbash binary and config files are in the build subdirectory.

Akbash can be customized through its config file (see etc subdirectory in sources).  

The following fields must be updated:

"wdog-listen-ip" : "192.168.1.105",
"wdog-listen-port" : "80",
"wdog-logFile" : "c:\\users\\admin\\desktop\\gpu\\akbash\\log.txt",
"wdog-notifications-email-address" : "your email goes here",
"miner-exe-full-path" : "c:\\users\\admin\\desktop\\gpu\\cgminer-btc.lnk",
"miner-exe-name" : "cgminer.exe",
"miner-listen-ip" : "127.0.0.1", 
"miner-listen-port" : "4028", 

cgminer/bfgminer config file has to be updated with:
"api-port" : "4028",
"api-listen" : true,
"api-network" : true,
"api-allow" : "W:127.0.0.1",

To run:
-------
c:\akbash\akbash akbash-btc.conf

or
