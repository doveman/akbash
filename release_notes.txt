New in version 1.0.9:
---------------------

    - fixed a bug in display of PGA devices in web status page; Akbash was 
	  limiting number of devices to GPU limit, which is 16 instead of PGA limit of 128
    - fixed problem with restarts due to disabled devices
    - fixed a bug in remote restart logic
    - added hardware errors, accepted and ratio of hardware errors as
      a ratio of hw errors to accepted count.  Both email and status web page
      have this new statistics
    - removed efficiency (e:) from the status page, replaced with hw/accepted percentage
	- reformatted web/email status pages to a more readable, table format

To install:
-----------

copy akbash.exe and akbash-btc.conf (akbash-ltc.conf) to any directory (eg. c:\akbash).  
Update akbash.conf with miner process lnk shortcut, location of log file, email address etc. 

If you compile from sources, akbash binary and config files are in the build subdirectory.

Akbash can be customized through its config file (see etc subdirectory in sources).  

The following fields must be updated:

"wdog-listen-ip" : "192.168.1.105",
"wdog-listen-port" : "80",
"wdog-logFile" : "c:\\users\\admin\\desktop\\gpu\\akbash\\log.txt",
"wdog-notifications-email-address" : "your email goes here",
"miner-exe-full-path" : "c:\\users\\admin\\desktop\\gpu\\cgminer-btc.lnk",
"miner-exe-name" : "cgminer.exe",
"miner-listen-ip" : "127.0.0.1", 
"miner-listen-port" : "4033", 

cgminer/bfgminer config file has to be updated with:
"api-port" : "4033",
"api-listen" : true,
"api-network" : true,
"api-allow" : "W:127.0.0.1",
