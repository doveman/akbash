binary:  https://github.com/af-newbie/akbash/build
source code: https://github.com/af-newbie/akbash


New in version 1.0.11
---------------------

    - reformatted the status page:
	    - removed hardware errors (as they are meaningless in ASICs world)
	    - added "Blocks Found" field
		- added target difficulty field
	- fixed "block found" email notifications
	- increased number of supported PGA devices to 384 (equivalent of 3 mini rigs running on 
	  the same miner instance).  Max supported GPUs is still 16.
	- added "miner-target-difficulty-url" : "https://blockchain.info/q/getdifficulty" to a config file.


To install:
-----------

copy akbash.exe and akbash-btc.conf (akbash-ltc.conf) to any directory (eg. c:\akbash).  
Update akbash.conf with miner process lnk shortcut, location of log file, email address etc. 

If you compile from sources, akbash binary and config files are in the build subdirectory.

Akbash can be customized through its config file (see etc subdirectory in sources).  

The following fields must be updated:

"wdog-listen-ip" : "192.168.1.105",
"wdog-listen-port" : "80",
"wdog-logFile" : "c:\\users\\admin\\desktop\\gpu\\akbash\\log.txt",
"wdog-notifications-email-address" : "your email goes here",
"miner-exe-full-path" : "c:\\users\\admin\\desktop\\gpu\\cgminer-btc.lnk",
"miner-exe-name" : "cgminer.exe",
"miner-listen-ip" : "127.0.0.1", 
"miner-listen-port" : "4028", 

cgminer/bfgminer config file has to be updated with:
"api-port" : "4028",
"api-listen" : true,
"api-network" : true,
"api-allow" : "W:127.0.0.1",
