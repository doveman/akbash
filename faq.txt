Q: What is akbash?
------------------------
A: akbash.exe is a Windows application that monitors execution of cgminer (bfgmainer) process.  It periodically checks status of each active GPU 
and/or PGA.  It monitors AMD GPU hardware to detect temperatures, fan speeds and mining activity. Hash rates of GPUs and PGAs are also monitored
and if any given hash average falls below configured threshold, it restarts the miner process.  Akbash can be run in smart metering mode
to improve GPU mining electricity costs.

The behaviour of akbash.exe can be customised through its JSON config file.

Q: What platforms does akbash runs on?
--------------------------------------------
A: Windows only.  It has only been tested on Windows 7.

Q: What does akbash do?
-----------------------------
A:  Here is a list of features:

   - detects miner crashes and restarts miner process automatically
   - monitors cgminer/bfgminer GPU and/or PGA hash rates and restarts (with a pause) miner process when rates fall below pre-configured threshold(s)
   - detects when the system is hung and reboots the OS
   - listens on pre-configured ip/port and responds to the following HTTP commands:  status, restart, reboot, getlog, help
   - can remotely restart miner process
   - can remotely reboot OS
   - provides miner status web page via remote HTTP status request
   - sends email notifications every time watchdog, miner or OS is restarted.  Also, it can be configured to send
     email status notifications.
   - provides pool balance, hash average, and pool efficiency in its status web page and email notification.
   - retrieves the latest BTC quotes: last/bid/ask and provides them in email and web status reports.
   - hardware monitoring of GPU temperature, fan speed and utilization, independent of info provided by miner API
   - detection of faulty/broken fans
   - detection of AMD driver crashes
   - monitoring of hardware errors and automatic restart of the miner process when thresholds are reached
   - restart/reboot reasons are provided in email notification reports
   - supports smart metering schedules to disable/enable GPU mining activity

Q: How do I install akbash?
---------------------------------
A: Please follow the following steps:

   1. Copy akbash.exe and akbash.conf files to a subdirectory on the PC that is running cgminer/bfgminer.
   2. Create a shortcut to "cgminer.exe -c my-cgminer.config" and place it on your desktop
   3. Edit akbash.conf to update .lnk and .log file paths, change other parameters to suit your environment.
   4. Enable "api-listen" : true in the cgminer/bfgminer config file. See cgminer/bfgminer configuration for details. Akbash communicates with cgminer/bfgminer
      through 127.0.0.1:4028 port. Please configure cgminer/bfgminer to listen on this ip and port.

	  Here are the recommended cgminer config entries:

			"api-listen" : true,
			"api-network" : true, 
			"api-allow" : "W:127.0.0.1", 


   5. If you want to receive email notifications, update your email address and email related fields in the config file.
   6. Add a shortcut to akbash to your Startup folder.  Do not add cgminer/bfgminer shortcut/bat to the Startup folder, just akbash.
      Watchdog will restart miner when OS is rebooted.
  
Q: How do I run akbash?
-----------------------------
A: Run "akbash akbash.conf" from the installation subdirectory or create a shortcut to that command and place it on your desktop.
   Point your browser to http://listen-ip:listen-port/ .  See "listen-ip", "listen-port" in the akbash.conf file.


Q: What are all these parameters in the conf file for?
------------------------------------------------------
A: Various functional areas can be controlled through settings in the config file.  Both field names and values should be
enclosed with double quotes.  They are all treated as strings by the JSON parser.

Logging:
--------
wdog-logFile  - location of akbash.exe log.  Log will grow until the files size reaches "log-file-size" in bytes.  
                Example:  "c:\\users\\admin\\desktop\\akbash.log"


wdog-log-file-size - max log file size before a new log file is created.  Recommended size is 500KB.  
                     Maximum size allowed is 2MB, or 2097152 bytes.  Minimum size is 20000 bytes.
                     When the maximum files size is reached, the current log is backed up as "logFile".001.txt
                     Three backup files (*.001.txt, *.002.txt, *.003.txt) are kept.  The latest log is dropped when a new backup file is created.
                     "getlog" HTTP command provides access to this log file remotely.  The backup files cannot be accesses remotely.

wdog-logging-level -  logging levels, possible values: 0, 1, 2, or 3

                      0 - only critical error messages are logged
                      1 - only severe/error messages are logged
                      2 - informational messages are logged in addition to severe and error messages
                      3 - all of the above plus debugging messages are logged.  With this level, about 3 days of logs will be kept.

                      Please note that starting with akbash version 1.0.4, logging level can be dynamically changed from akbash window by pressing 
                      0, 1, 2 or 3. 

Miner Monitoring:
-----------------
miner-exe-full-path - this parameter defines a shortcut to execute/restart cgminer.exe/bfgminer.exe.  
                      Please define .lnk shortcut and specify its location in this entry.
                      akbash will use this entry to restart cgminer.exe when any of the restart triggers are met.
                      Example:  "c:\\users\\admin\\desktop\\cgminer.lnk"

miner-exe-name - this is the name of miner process.  Default is "cgminer.exe".

miner-init-interval - miner intialization wait time in seconds.  akbash will wait "miner-init-interval" seconds
                      before trying to read GPU/PGA status(es) after a restart or reboot. Minimum interval is 30 seconds,
                      also a default value.

miner-gpu-avg-rate-threshold - the lowest average hash rate in Mh/s below which GPUs cannot fall for more than "alive-timeout"
                               (see below) seconds.  If a GPU spends more than "alive-timeout" with avg rate below this threshold,
                               miner will be restarted. Default value is 300.

miner-pga-avg-rate-threshold - the lowest average hash rate in Mh/s below which GPUs cannot fall for more than "alive-timeout"
                               (see below) seconds.  If a PGA spends more than "alive-timeout" with avg rate below this threshold,
                               miner will be restarted. Default value is 200.

miner-working-set-threshold - the upper threshold for miner process working set memory [in mega bytes].  Default is 600 MB.

miner-handle-count-threshold - the upper threshold for miner process handle count [number of open handles]. Default is 10,000.

miner-number-of-restarts - number of miner restarts before OS is rebooted.  If miner is restarted "number-of-restarts"+ 1 times,
                           Windows will be rebooted automatically. Default value is 10.

miner-alive-timeout - this is the interval in seconds for performing GPU/PGA hash rate checks.  Default value is 120, also a minimum
                      value.

miner-not-connected-timeout - akbash might lose connectivity with miner process due to high load or miner becoming unresponsive.  
                              If akbash fails to reconnect within this timeout (in seconds) miner will be restarted.
                              Default value is 60 seconds, also a minimum value.

miner-hw-errors-threshold - if h/w errors as reported by miner API are greaterthan this threshold, miner will be restarted.
                            Minimum value is 0, also a default value.

miner-notify-when-block-found - set it to 1 if you want to receive email notifications when your miner solves a block

wdog-cutoff-temperature - if temperature of any GPU reaches this value at any time, miner will be stopped for "wdog-cutoff-temperature-cooldown-period"
                          minutes.  Default value is 86C.

wdog-cutoff-temperature-cooldown-period - cooldown period in minutes after cutoff temperature has been reached. Default value is 5 minutes.

wdog-disable-hw-monitoring - hardware (GPU) monitoring can be enabled or disabled with this entry.

                         0 - hardware monitoring will be enabled
                         1 - hardware monitoring will be disabled

wdog-hw-monitoring-interval - how often (in seconds) to read GPU temperature and utilization? Default value is 60 (seconds), also a minimum value.
                                    
wdog-gpu-utilization-threshold - Percentage of GPU utilization below which miner will be restarted. Default is 20 %.
                                 Minimum value is 10 %. This threshold will be used only when miner is in ALIVE or comes out of ALIVE states.

wdog-gpu-utilization-timeout - If GPU utilization (as read from the hardware) stays below "wdog-gpu-utilization-threshold" for "wdog-gpu-utilization-timeout"
                               seconds, the miner process will be restarted.  Default value is 80 seconds, also a minimum value.
							   This timeout should be greater than "wdog-hw-monitoring-interval" for obvious reasons.

							   
Miner APIs:
-----------
By default, akbash connects to 127.0.0.1:4028 to query miner for its status and statistics of each gpu/pga.

miner-api-poll-interval - this is similar to "alive-timeout" but internally, this value is used to perform the actual
                          socket connections to  127.0.0.1:4028.  Default value is 20 seconds, also a minimum value.
                          The maximum value is 120 seconds.  "alive-timeout" is used to wake up monitoring thread to
                          check the rates/statues from a local cache.  This interval controls the thread that gets the
                          status/statistics from the miner process.

miner-listen-ip - cgminer should bind to this ip and listen on "miner-listen-port" for API commands.  Defualt value is "127.0.0.1".

miner-listen-port - cgminer should be configured to listen on this port.  Default value is 4028.

Here are example entries (from cgminer configuration file) to configure cgminer to listen on 127.0.0.1@4030

"api-listen" : true,
"api-port" : "4030",
"api-network" : true, 
"api-allow" : "W:127.0.0.1", 

Please refer to cgminer documentation for more detailed description of the above entries.

miner-solo-mining - this entry enables pool monitoring feature.  Akbash will check periodically if shares are being accepted by the pool.
                    If miner is solo mining, set this entry to 1, if you are connecting to a pool, set it to 0.

HTTP access:
------------
akbash listens on TCP port for incoming connections and responds to the following commands:

   http://listen_ip:listen_port/wd_cmd=help;     -  help page
   http://listen_ip:listen_port/wd_cmd=status;   -  watchdog, miner and pool status/statistics page
   http://listen_ip:listen_port/wd_cmd=restart;  -  restarts miner process
   http://listen_ip:listen_port/wd_cmd=reboot;   -  restarts Windows
   http://listen_ip:listen_port/wd_cmd=getlog;   -  displays the latest log file
   http://listen_ip:listen_port/wd_cmd=switch_poolN;   -  switches current pool to pool 'N', eg. http://listen_ip:listen_port/wd_cmd=switch_pool1

Port and IP are configurable.

wdog-listen-ip - akbash will bind and listen on this IP for new incoming HTTP connections. Default is 127.0.0.1

wdog-listen-port - akbash will bind and listen on this port for new incoming HTTP connections. Default is 80

                         0 - remote HTTP commands will be enabled
                         1 - remote HTTP commands will be disabled

wdog-disable-remote-help - "help" command can be individually enabled or disabled with this entry.

                         0 - remote HTTP "help" command will be enabled
                         1 - remote HTTP "help" command will be disabled

wdog-disable-remote-restart - "restart" command can be individually enabled or disabled with this entry.

                         0 - remote HTTP "restart" command will be enabled

                         0 - remote HTTP "status" command will be enabled
                         1 - remote HTTP "status" command will be disabled

Pool Info:
----------
akbash will periodically query pre-configured pool to retrieve balance and hash rates.
Valids, stales and invalids will also be stored and used for pool efficiency calculation:
  
       pool efficiency = valids/(valids+stales+invalids);

Pool statistics is included in status email and web page.

disable-pool-info - pool monitoring will be disabled if this value is set to 0

pool-refresh-interval - how ofter to ping the pool (in minutes).  Default value is 5 minutes, also a minimum value.

pool-api-url - pool API url.  Example:
               http://www.abcpool.co/api.php?api_key=2db4c9e0b7534d4741aef0d4628292ec047ed3ad647bd7a4ca13af2db3f8fbfe

pool-balance-label - a string label to look for in the JSON return string to get BTC balance.  For abcpool.co, it is
                     "confirmed_rewards"

pool-hash-rate-label - a string label to look for in the JSON return string to get BTC balance.  For abcpool.co, it is
                     "hashrate"


pool-hash-valids-label - a string label to look for in the JSON return string to get BTC balance.  For abcpool.co, it is
                     "running_valids"

pool-hash-stales-label - a string label to look for in the JSON return string to get BTC balance.  For abcpool.co, it is
                     "running_stales"

pool-hash-invalids-label - a string label to look for in the JSON return string to get BTC balance.  For abcpool.co, it is
                     "running_invalids"

Email Notifications:
--------------------
akbash will send email notifications in the following cases:

  - watchdog is restarted (manually or during OS reboot)
  - miner is restarted
  - OS is rebooted
  - email status notifications as configured in the config file

wdog-disable-notification-emails - 1 disables all email notifications, 0 enables it

wdog-disable-status-notifications - 1 disables status email notifications, 0 enables it

wdog-notifications-email-address - valid email address to send the watchdog emails to.  Please setup your email client
                                   to receive emails with subject line containing "akbash".  Yahoo seems to place
                                   akbash emails in inbox without any additional setup, but other email servers
                                   might misplace them as junk email.  Yahoo email service is recommended.
                                   Their email servers are robust and responsive.  Hotmail is good but their anti-spam
                                   software checks the source IP, and most likely, your IP is not on their white list so your email notifications will
                                   be marked as spam.
 
wdog-status-notification-frequency - this entry determines how often to send emails status notifications in minutes.
                                     Default value is 15 minutes, it is also a minimum value. It is recommended
                                     that you set this setting to 60 minutes or higher, especially if you run
                                     many rigs.

wdog-rig-name - a unique name that identifies a mining rig.  This name willbe used in the subject line of all akbash emails

BTC Quotes:
-----------
The latest quotes from any pre-configured provider are periodically retrieved and are included in the web and email status reports.
Retrieval of quotes is done in the same thread that is doing pool statistics so quotes will be retrieved every "pool-refresh-interval" minutes.
I think this is optimal.  No nee to run another thread just for quotes.

btc-disable-quotes - enables/disables retrieval of BTC quotes

                         0 - retrieval of BTC quotes will be enabled
                         1 - retrieval of BTC quotes  will be disabled

btc-refresh-interval- how often to query the BTC prices provider (in minutes).  Default value is 5 minutes, also a minimum value.

btc-quote-url - enter the URL to query for JSON style quotes.  Recommended site is "https://mtgox.com/api/0/data/ticker.php", but you can configure
                any other site that returns JSON string provided you configure last/bid/ask labels as specified below.

btc-quote-last-label - this is a string label to look for "last" quote in the JSON string.  For mtgox.com, use "last_all"

btc-quote-bid-label - this is a string label to look for "bid or buy" quote in the JSON string.  For mtgox.com, use "buy"

btc-quote-ask-label - this is a string label to look for "ask or sell" quote in the JSON string.  For mtgox.com, use "sell"

Smart Metering:
---------------
Smart metering feature allows an operator to configure ON/OFF GPU mining schedules based on local electric company electricity rates.
This helps to save money by not using GPUs during ON-PEAK, high rate periods.  If your electric company charges different rates based
on time of use, you might want to enable this feature.

smart-metering-disable - enables/disables smart metering feature

                         0 - smart metering feature will be enabled
                         1 - smart metering feature will be disabled

smart-metering-polling-interval - how often (in minutes) to poll the system clock to detect smart metering schedules.  Default value is 1 minute.
 
smart-metering-on-peak-start-time - start time of a HIGH DEMAND/HIGEST electricity rate period.  Default value is "11:00" (eleven o'clock in the morning).
                                    The time has to be entered based on a 24 hour clock.  "17:00" instead of "5pm".

smart-metering-off-peak-start-time - start time of LOW DEMAND/LOWEST electricity rate period.  Default value is "17:00" (five o'clock in the afternoon).
                                     The time has to be entered based on a 24 hour clock.  "17:00" instead of "5pm".

smart-metering-on-peak-shutdown - Default value is "0".  Reserved for future use.
 
smart-metering-on-peak-disable-gpus - determines whether to disable GPUs during ON-PEAK period.  Default value is "1" (disable GPUs).

Q: My miner is not running, akbash has entered NOT_CONNECTED state but it does not restart my miner?  Why not?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: It will.  You just have to let it.  Watchdog will not restart miner just because it lost connectivity to the process.
Sometimes on very busy system the connection might timeout (there is 10 second timeout on its local connect() socket calls).
So akbash tries to connect several times (see "not-connected-timeout") before deciding it is time to restart miner process.
One last thing you want is to restart miner for no apparent reason.  This also allows for miner to recover by itself if it can.

Q: How do I terminate akbash.exe?
---------------------------------------
A: 'q' or 'Q' (just like cgminer.exe), or CTRL+C.  Both are detected so that akbash can shutdown properly.

Q: I have question or suggestion.  How to reach you?
